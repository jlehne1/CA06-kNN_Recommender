# CA06-kNN_Recommender

This assignment requires the creation of a recommender system for movies given certain values including IMDB rating and genre.  The assignment called for creating a model to get recommendations from a movie dataset given the values for "The Post" (which is not in the dataset).  

I was able to use a kNN model to build the recommendation system and create the recommended movie output.  See the code for more detail and comments about the process and code in-line as comments

In addition to completing this part of the assignment, I wanted to try and create an "automated" function that would allow me to type in a movie name in the dataset and the number of recommendations and recieve an output of the recommended outputs.  Even though this function is limited to the 30 movies in the dataset, with some minor changes it could likely be applied to a larger dataset.
